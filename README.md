# ATA App (AskThemAll)

## Overview
ATA App (AskThemAll) is a platform that aggregates AI chatbot responses in one place. Instead of manually inputting a prompt into multiple AI models, ATA App sends the same prompt to various AI chatbots (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Copilot) and displays their responses side by side for easy comparison. This saves time and provides users with diverse perspectives on their queries.

## Features
### **1. Homepage (Main Interface)**
- **Single Input Field:** Users enter a prompt once.
- **Multi-AI Response Display:** Responses from multiple AI models are shown in separate cards.
- **User Feedback:** Users can upvote, rate, and compare AI responses.

### **2. User Dashboard (After Login)**
- **Saved Prompts & History:** Users can access past queries and responses.
- **Subscription Management:** Allows users to manage premium AI subscriptions.
- **Personalized AI Preferences:** Customize which AI models to use.
- **Analytics:** Tracks AI performance and popular responses.

### **3. Subscription & Pricing**
- **Free vs. Premium Plans:** Access basic features for free or subscribe for premium AI access.
- **Unified Subscription Management:** Users can manage multiple AI premium plans in one place.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Supports Stripe, PayPal, and other payment options.

### **4. Admin Panel (For Future Expansion)**
- **User & Subscription Management:** Manage user accounts and access levels.
- **API Usage Monitoring:** Track and optimize AI API calls.
- **AI Performance Metrics:** Identify top-performing AI responses.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js (or similar for a responsive UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI, Django)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase
